We have used the file named as "All Parameters" in our visualisation, we all the other parameters are combined.
You can visit the visualisation Part for Lendiya Lake and observe the Graph, what story does this Data tells you & What are the conclusion.

Ph is between 7.4 to 8.2 => higher pH means Basic Properties in water, Drinkable Water pH is 7 to 8 

Chlorophyll is Normalised => higher values means presence of Algae or any materials with the ability to use Photosynthesis

Tubidity is Normalised => higher values of turbidity means less clarity in water, thus "Not Drinkable"

Dissolved Oxygen (DO) in mg/L & normalised (2 csv) => Higher Values of DO signifies more oxygen in water, which is good for aquatic life & also "Drinkable"

Dissolved Organic Matter(DOM) is Normalised => More DOM means decomposable object are present in the water, good for aquatic life

Temperature in Degree Celcius => Surface temperature of water

Suspended Matter => What are the oganic/inorganic matter present in the water
